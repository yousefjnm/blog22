So this week we created a new container on Docker and named it as "lab1". We then installe Nano text editor and alson installed Apache and run it. Then we had to install MySQL and PHP and restarted the Apache. After that we were able to view our webpage. Then we cloned a repositry that has a working application and we did a few modifications on some files. After that we installed a composer and then we had to create a Dockerfile that does all those previous steps automatically but we were not sure how to finsh it and so we will seek help from the professor in the next class.
